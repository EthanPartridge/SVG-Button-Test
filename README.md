# SVGButtonTest
HTML/CSS/Javascript project which uses SVG files to create custom buttons.

## Overview
I created two custom buttons in Adobe Illustrator and exported them as SVG files. I set the gray x button as the default button background image using CSS.
Once the user clicks the button, a Javascript function is triggered which changes the button background image to the red x button and sets the button value to true.
The value of the button is displayed.

## Why I Created This Project
I wanted to use a custom shaped button on a habit tracking website I am working on, so I used this project as a testing ground for ideas on how to achieve that goal.
I also wanted to learn more about using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
